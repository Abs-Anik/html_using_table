				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><img src="ip.png" alt="ip" width="150px"></li>
					<li>Today, ten percent of the Alexa Top 1000 websites are now enabled with IPv6 and large access networks have enabled IPv6 for their end users, according to measurements we made for World IPv6 Launch.

                   Four of the five largest websites in the world – Google, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo!, and Wikipedia – all serve IPv6 from their main websites today. In addition, content distribution networks like Limelight and Akamai are providing services to their customers to enable IPv6 hosted content, and hosting companies are making it possible for hosted websites to use IPv6 as well. The three largest web-hosting companies in Germany serve IPv6 for all their hosted websites.

                  Also at the end of 2012, there were significant deployments in access networks. AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and Comcast in North America, RCS&RDS in Romania, CTC and Softbank in Japan, XS4ALL in the Netherlands, Swisscom in Switzerland, DT in Germany, and Internode in Australia all began enabling IPv6 for their end users, all without the end users needing to configure anything in their networks, and in fact, probably, most not even knowing they are using IPv6.</li>

				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><img src="l.jpeg" alt="ip" width="150px"></li>
					<li>Leap Motion is the first serious mainstream contender for a high fidelity gesture peripheral. It tracks the movement of hands in two square feet of space above it with unbelievable speed and accuracy.

					The first question everybody asks is, ‘So what can it do?’. The short answer is, today, very little. Tomorrow? Well, I for one am a believer. What we have here is a limitation of imagination, not of technology. That is usually a catalyst for innovation.</li>

				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><img src="ftc.jpeg" alt="ftc" width="150px"></li>
					<li>Apple’s new Health app – and the HealthKit platform that lets other companies’ health and activity-tracking apps tie into it – was one of the big new features in its iOS 8 software, which launched a couple of months ago.

					Health is capable of collecting, storing and analysing a range of personal data, but there are clear privacy implications here – for Apple and any company involved in this space, from Google and Microsoft to the growing number of smaller fitness-focused app and device makers.</li>

				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><img src="ss.png" alt="ftc" width="150px"></li>
					<li>The most popular messaging apps have hundreds of millions of users, but how secure are they really? The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been finding out, producing a “secure messaging scorecard” to rate them on a range of criteria.

					Are messages encrypted in transit, and encrypted so the provider can’t read them? Can you verify contacts’ identities? Are past communications secure if your keys are stolen? Is the code open to independent review, is the security design properly documented, and has the code been audited?</li>

			<li><h3>Android Lollipop rolls out with sweet design focus </h3>
				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><img src="an.png" alt="ftc" width="150px"></li>
					<li>Designing the perfect Lollipop? Strawberry and sherbert, and it should be the size of my face, please.

                    But no, Google’s latest post on its Official Android Blog is less about sweets-on-sticks and more about Android Lollipop, the latest version of its smartphone and tablet software.

                    It started rolling out to devices this week, and colleague Sam Gibbs has already put the new software through its paces with a five-star review:

                    Lollipop is a complete visual overhaul of the standard Android look, making it a much smoother, more coherent and connected experience – a big step up compared to previous iterations of Google’s software.
                    It is also faster, lighter on battery and adds a lot of what third-party manufacturers have had to manually bolt on to their customised versions of Android.
 
                    Is the company onto something? If you’re using Lollipop already on one or more devices, how are you finding it, and do you think material design will deliver on Google’s promises?

                    What new features are looking most useful, and what would you like to see added in future updates? How do you think Android Lollipop stacks up compared to Apple’s iOS 8? The comments are open for your views.

                   What else is on the technology radar today? A few links to chew over:

                   Social service Ask.fm, which has faced scrutiny over cyberbullying, is appointing a law enforcement affairs officer and providing more information on how to block and report users and ‘problematic’ content.

                   Christies is preparing to auction off the “only known surviving Apple-1 documented to have been sold directly by  Steve Jobs to an individual from his parents’ garage”. Although you may need up to $600,000 to nab it.

                   US startup Paracosm certainly sounds ambitious: it’s raised $3.3m of funding to, in CEO Amir Rubin’s words, “take the digital world beyond screens and enable machines to understand the world as we do, turning your living room into a holodeck”.

                     Veteran technology site CNET is launching... a print magazine? Yep. A print magazine. It’ll be quarterly with an initial print run of 200,000 copies and exclusive articles. “We’re trying to make a statement that we’re investing in print because we think it’s a viable way to reach this audience...”
